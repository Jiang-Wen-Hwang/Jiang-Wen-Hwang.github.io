    I was born, studied, worked and founded my business in Hsinchu and have 
    established companies in Hsinchu, Shanghai, and Suzhou. Our company 
    specializes in the semiconductor industry. After having complete experience 
    in the semiconductor industry with 6/8/12 inches (micrometer/sub-micrometer/nanometer), 
    I went to the Hukou Industrial Zone to manage a factory engineering department 
    with nearly 200 people and founded several domestic and overseas companies. 
    Therefore, I have complete management and operations experience, from dozens of 
    engineers to hundreds of people to several managers. Current main duties: 
    Formulate the company's long-term and short-term strategic planning and annual 
    operating plan and lead the correct decision-making on the company's major 
    investments and operating activities. Manage and control risks and guide each 
    department to ensure that their business direction is consistent with the 
    company's operating objectives. Adjust marketing strategies and practices based 
    on current market conditions to achieve the company's business management and 
    development goals.
