  I was born, studied, worked and founded my business in Hsinchu and have established companies 
  in Hsinchu, Shanghai, and Suzhou. Our company specializes in the semiconductor industry. After 
  having complete experience in the semiconductor industry with 6/8/12 inches (micrometer/sub-
  micrometer/nanometer), I went to the Hukou Industrial Zone to manage a factory engineering 
  department with nearly 200 people and founded several domestic and overseas companies. Therefore, 
  I have complete management and operations experience, from dozens of engineers to hundreds of 
  people to several managers. Current main duties: Formulate the company's long-term and short-term 
  strategic planning and annual operating plan and lead the correct decision-making on the company's 
  major investments and operating activities. Manage and control risks and guide each department to 
  ensure that their business direction is consistent with the company's operating objectives. Adjust 
  marketing strategies and practices based on current market conditions to achieve the company's 
  business management and development goals.
